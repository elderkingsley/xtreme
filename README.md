Xtremehost website - My first HTML/CSS/JS site
## Details

Today is the 15th day of October, 2022 and I just began learning html and css about a month ago and hope I can at least be proficient enough to comfortably build e-commerce sites withn the next 6-9 months.

This is my first project and its a website for a web hosting company.
Previously, I had bulit this and other websites on Wordpress, but now, I want 
to rebuild all 4 sites I currently mannage on wordpress with HTML, CSS & JS.

All these sites are e-commerce sites, so I hope after building them here I should be pretty confident to take up other projects.
